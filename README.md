## Frameworks Used
This project utilizes the [MEVN](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-mevn-stack) stack. The following are the technologies used in this stack:
### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## About the System
<p align="justify">
   The <strong>Exam Management System</strong> or <strong>Student Assessment Management System</strong> aims to create an information system that enables the digitization of tasks concerned with student grades (these basic tasks are listed below). The rationale for creating such a system is to minimize, or possibly eliminate, the need for paper and other physical means of storing student grades or records. The system would allow for the decluttering of tables, shelves, filing cabinets, and other spaces which would be otherwise filled with the aforementioned student records. Furthermore, the system was designed with teachers, students, and other school personnel in mind.
</p>
<p align="justify">
   As previously mentioned, the main users of this system will be the teachers, students, and school personnel that handle student records. In its current state, the system allows a teacher user to record and view student grades. Additionally, they can distribute report cards remotely. Student users can view their grades inputted by teacher users and retrieve their report cards. Other personnel, a printing administrator for example, have the ability to create report cards and view student grades as well.
</p>
   
### Functionalities
The main system is designed to accomplish these basic tasks:
* Record grades
* View grades
* Create report cards
* Distribute report cards

### Possible Sub-Systems
The current system can be further improved and augmented through the implementation of sub-systems with additional functionalities.
* Student Profiling System
* Teacher Profiling System
* Curriculum Management System
* Grade Appeal System
